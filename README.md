# Monster Train Modding Template

This repo holds a bunch of sample code regarding modding Monster Train. Feel free to use, reference, modify, pilfer, or otherwise utilize it as you like.

The various examples are not meant to be played with and will not result in enjoyable gameplay. They exist solely for the benefit of up-and-coming Monster Train modders.

Adopted from https://github.com/KittenAqua/MonsterTrainSampleMod credit to KittenAqua and contributors for the base code. 

This codebase has been updated for use with Trainworks Modding Tools, supports the Monster Train TLD DLC.
